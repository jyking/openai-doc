Learn how to generate or manipulate text

## 介绍
The completions endpoint can be used for a wide variety of tasks. It provides a simple but powerful interface to any of our models. You input some text as a prompt, and the model will generate a text completion that attempts to match whatever context or pattern you gave it. For example, if you give the API the prompt, "As Descartes said, I think, therefore", it will return the completion " I am" with high probability.
