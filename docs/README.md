# Introduction

## Overview

The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language, code, or images. We offer a spectrum of models with different levels of power suitable for different tasks, as well as the ability to fine-tune your own custom models. These models can be used for everything from content generation to semantic search and classification.

## Key concepts
We recommend completing our quickstart tutorial to get acquainted with key concepts through a hands-on, interactive example.

## Prompts
Designing your prompt is essentially how you “program” the model, usually by providing some instructions or a few examples. This is different from most other NLP services which are designed for a single task, such as sentiment classification or named entity recognition. Instead, the completions and chat completions endpoint can be used for virtually any task including content or code generation, summarization, expansion, conversation, creative writing, style transfer, and more.
